Techfest MMC India Challenge #1

## Document generation process is easy
Upload a template > Upload data and generate document > View generated documents

## {{ Template }}
The template follows a standard templating format called Jinja, which is used in many organisations. This makes our templates highly portable and easy to use.


## Key Features
  + {{ Templates }}
      - Simple but Powerful templates- supports nesting
      - In GUI document editor - built from scratch
      - Styling retained in generated document
      - Versioning and locally available templates
  + Intelligent data upload
      - Simple & Intelligent mapping mechanism 
  + Generation of documents
      - Localization based on currency and date
      - Mapping prompt and intelligent recommendations
      - Styling retained as in template
  + Bulk generation
      - 2 way bulk generation
      
  + System
      - Support for Microsoft Office Suite & Linux
      - PDF format
      - Email support
      - Load balancing
      - Asynchronous requests and response, scales to multiple requests
   +  Security
      - OAuth Single Sign-on (works with MS accounts)
      - Data location encryption - AES
      
## Intelligence - AI Engine

    + Template Generator sub-module
      - NLP sub-module
      - Custom-made NLP Pipeline (Tokenizer, Tagger, Parser)
      - Stream-wise, pipelined processing of text as opposed to line-by-line scanning
      - Template field identifier - textual context differentiation 

    + Template field - Client field Mapping sub-module
      - Intelligent, Feedback based recommender system
      - Potentially scalable accuracy with time 
      - Dataset generation with time

    + Autoencoder-classifier sub-module (data required)
      - Lower level embedding representation learning 
      - Decoder replaced by classifier after training autoencoder 
      - Increased precision in classification of tag of a word (app/document specific)

    + Auto-tagging of templates ( in the process of integration)
